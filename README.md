Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI- aided web page for SME´s who are considering expanding their business abroad


## Background

It can be in many SME´s that it is hard to find time to assess expanding possibilities. Rather the time goes to managing day to day tasks and during this pandemic, trying to survive. Nevertheless, thriving companies have a vision pass the pandemic and work hard to reach the goals they have made for their business´s future. Expanding a business is a puzzle needing different pieces to be successful. You might need information on competition in another country or region, you might need links of information on different ways on getting funding to be able to expand. You might need links to different consultants on marketing, digitalization or perhaps on regulation. This kind of webpage could be maybe generated and operated by AI – needing of course some supervising. 


## How is it used?

Webpage would be public information source for anyone interested on getting info collected to one webpage instead of scattered around and hard to find.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data would be collected form already existing sources. For example, from OECD (data on specific countries of interest), Customs (data on international trade in goods, in different product categories), Business Finland (info links about internationalization advice services, funding, expert selection and so on.)

Webpage could be enridged by adding AI techniques to it. For example, you could optimize the shortest route with least carbon emissions to get the goods into another country by calculating the route emissions from your home port to another. 

There could be probability calculations for example on finding workers for a specific occupation group at a specific country using employment statistics. Maybe also info how to segment customer base or zip code evaluation to determine the economic status of customers in specific area. There could be machine learning techniques like the nearest neighbor classifier to determine if countries import in certain product group are the same kind. Also, linear regression could be used to predict demand for products in certain area. Possibilities are endless and really is about what SME´s consider important when assessing the possibilities to expand.


## Challenges

Choosing the best and relevant issues on the webpage that would save time and costs of the SME´s. Someone should “own” the page and correct broken data. Users should realize that there are no absolute trues on that page but could be used as a tool in assessment.


## Acknowledgments

Huge thank you for the Building AI team for making it possible to learn about AI! It would be amazing to continue with this idea with interested AI experts to help the SME´s and Finland :)
